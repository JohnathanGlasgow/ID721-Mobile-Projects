# Runny Run
**A game by Johnathan Glasgow**

### Play Store link
The game is still under review, but the public link seems as though it is working:
[Public Play Store Listing](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.banjaxstudio.runnyrun&hl=en-US&ah=_NAjoPYVniMT1bMSRPZSgkhp51M)

If for whatever reason that doesn't work, then the internal testing version is here:

### Concept and Genre
This is a simple endless runner type game.

### Gameplay Loop
The gameplay revolves around collecting rings while avoiding obstacles. The player may attempt to beat their high score. As the game progresses, more difficult obstacles appear. They also move faster as the game progresses.

### Controls
By tapping the screen, the player jumps. By holding jump longer, the jump height is extended.

### Art Style
The game has vibrant graphics reminiscient of 90's futurism. With the exception of the ring model and the font, I created the visual assets for this game using Procreate.

### Audio
The SFX were created by Dominic Braun and are available freely [here](https://dominik-braun.net/retro-sounds/).

I did the music.

### Bugs
As of writing there are no known bugs.
