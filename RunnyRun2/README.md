If for whatever reason that doesn't work then the internal testing version should instead:

### Concept and Genre
This is a simple endless runner type game.

### Gameplay Loop
The gameplay revolves around collecting rings while avoiding obstacles. The player may attempt to beat their high score. As the game progresses, more difficult obstacles appear. They also move faster as the game progresses.

### Controls
By tapping the screen, the player jumps. By holding jump longer, the jump height is extended.

### Art Style
The game has vibrant graphics reminiscient of 90's futurism.

### Audio
The SFX were created by Dominic Braun and are available freely [here](https://dominik-braun.net/retro-sounds/).

### Bugs
As of writing there are no known bugs.
